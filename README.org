* Hass Config Editor
*** Overview
    If you've ever need to make mass edits to your dashboard, you'll find there's no API in Home Assistant to do so.
    However, the config *is* there to be edited, you just have to get to it.  This is a small Deno script that uses the
    HomeAssistant websocket API to get and set configs the same way that Lovelace does.
*** Running
    [[https://deno.com/manual@v1.33.2/getting_started/installation][Install Deno]].

    Create a long-lived API token for your Home Assistant user, and then create a ~.env~ file in the base directory like so:
    #+begin_src
      HASS_TOKEN=<your token>
    #+end_src

    Download your lovelace dashboard as JSON.
    #+begin_src bash
      deno run --allow-net --allow-read=.env,.env.defaults clients.ts get > dashboard.json
    #+end_src

    Edit it as you see fit, then upload it back:
    #+begin_src bash
      deno run --allow-net --allow-read=.env,.env.defaults clients.ts set < dashboard.json
    #+end_src
